                            Three artists across India, South Africa, and the UK will develop an innovative immersive artwork exploring food systems, 
                            regenerative agricultural practices, and indigenous knowledge. The collaboration will focus on using sustainable digital production tools; 
                            setting a new precedent for environmentally conscious creative digital practices.
