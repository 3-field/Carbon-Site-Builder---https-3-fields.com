			<h3 class="subtext editable">
                            Three artists across India, South Africa, and the UK will develop an innovative immersive artwork exploring food systems, 
                            regenerative agricultural practices, and indigenous knowledge. The collaboration will focus on using sustainable digital production tools; 
                            setting a new precedent for environmentally conscious creative digital practices.

                                    is an artist-researcher who has a strong material engagement with food, land, water, and the politics of how humans relate to and through these. 
                                    Their co-creation practice explores how making in collaboration with diverse communities (human, microbial, and otherwise) can be a way to recover 
                                    climate practices that open up new speculations on how we might live in the future.
