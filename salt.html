Salt is a prototype game produced by artist Kaajal Modi for EyeMyth Festival, 2026 as part of THREE FIELDS.

THREE FIELDS is a collaboration by three artists across India (Deepa Reddy), South Africa (Samukelisiwe Dube), and the UK (Kaajal Modi) developing an innovative immersive artwork exploring food systems, regenerative agricultural practices, and Indigenous knowledge. 

The collaboration focused on using sustainable digital production tools; setting a new precedent for environmentally conscious creative digital practices.
