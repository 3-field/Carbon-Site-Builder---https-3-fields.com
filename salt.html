In my kitchen, I have: 

a fine table salt, two types of [[sea salt]], a [[kala namak]] and a [[pink salt]]. 

The table salt is harvested by Saxa from fields in Cheshire, the brine pumped to the surface and processed to remove impurities, transferred to factories in Worksop and Kent (47 and 259 miles respectively from where I presently sit) where it is then evaporated in a vacuum process, dried, and crushed and screened before being packaged with Sodium Hexacyanoferrate II (to prevent caking). 

One [[sea salt]] is 'produced' in the same place, using a natural evaporation process. A process which is less efficient, and takes much more time and labour. 

Saxa admits to sourcing much of their salt from British Salts, a company that has produced salts for the chemical industry, road safety and medical grade salts since 1969. British Salts is part of Tata Chemicals Europe, which is owned by Tata Group, an Indian multinational conglomerate founded in 1868 headquartered in Mumbai. 

The other [[sea salt]] is harvested from the Blackwater Estuary River in Maldon, Essex, 227 miles from where I presently sit, using a natural evaporation process that has changed little in 140 years (this is my most expensive salt). 

The [[kala namak]] (black salt) and [[pink salt]] are both from the Himalayas (about 4900 miles from where I presently sit).

"India is the world’s third largest producer of salt after China and the US. About 70% of the approx. 19 million tons annually produced comes from the western state of Gujarat. Indian salt production is labor intensive, engaging some 150,000 workers daily, the majority of them in the scorching Gujarat desert. Marakkanam produces 50,000 tonnes of salt annually from 3,300 acres, owned largely by small producers.

"What are the lives of [[those who are steeped in salt->kin]], literally in the corrosive, scorching evaporation ponds raking out crystal salt? Now that large-scale manufacturing and packaging processes have been well-honed to extract uncommon value from common salt, salt is among the world’s cheapest substances; mercantile empires are built from other things these days. And yet salt is a functioning empire without which we cannot do. What sort of labor does that empire command?"

An ionic compound formed by the neutralisation reaction 
of an acid and a base, consisting of positively charged metal 
or ammonium ions (cations) and negatively charged non-metal ions (anions).

For the purposes of this work, you will (mainly) be considering 
sodium chloride (NaCl), known as table salt, which is produced 
by neutralizing hydrochloric acid (HCl) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).

This is the salt around you, that you recognise as part of you. 
That maintains the pressure of your blood and raises it, 
that buoys you on water and drowns you under it.

Kala namak is a sulphorous, pungent tickle in your nose and on your tongue. It is made by heating crystalline sodium chloride with charcoal and amla (Phyllanthus emblica), Harad (Terminalia chebula), Behera (Terminalia bellerica), Babul bark (Vachellianilotica) and Natron (Sodium carbonate decahydrate). It is an acquired taste, something like sulphur, like eggs, the spice equivalent of Marmite or coriander or olives or liquorice. 

In Ayurveda it is a remedy for indigestion, containing iron and magnesium. It can be smeared on the skin or added to a bath to reduce the inflammation of skin and bones. When ground into a powder, the black salt’s colour ranges from pink to black-brown to black, breaking apart like tender charred crystalline flesh under your mortar and pestle.

Himalayan pink salt is pink because it is rusty, the iron oxide lending it a bloody tinge. You are told it contains 80 different minerals, including calcium, magnesium, and potassium, and as you place it on your tongue you wonder if you can taste all of them. You wonder if that taste matters when the health benefits are reduced down to a list that you will consume dutifully alongside my medicine. 

Pink salt mainly mined in Pakistan, mainly sold to India, mainly bought cheap and repackaged and sold on at a profit using the spiritual cachet European and the US markets afford this place that lives almost entirely in their imaginations, a mineral that is a food that is a geography and a medicine rendered as a health commodity by a global wellness industrial complex that cannot imagine its own injustices even as it enacts them, even as it profits from them.

//“You broke the ocean in half to be here. Only to meet nothing that wants you.” //
(text-size: 0.75)[Nayyirah Waheed, salt., 2013.]


When I tell you I am salty, you must wonder, where does that saltiness come from? I live in a town without salt, yet salt lives in my blood. It is in the extracellular fluid, the blood plasma and the liquid matter surrounding my cells. 

Rusty pink salt maintaining the pressure of my plasma, carrying transmitting signals from the brain to the muscles of my body, (sodium ion) facilitating nerve impulses and muscle contractions, creating electrical charges across cell membranes. 

I am a body of brine, a conduit of meaning and matter that stretches from my cells to my kitchen to the rivers to the ocean. 

Namakh and mitthu and haraam and halal

Salt for salary, salt for savoury, salt for luck and salt for hydration, salting the earth for luck and salting the earth so nothing can ever grow there again

Salt sacred and profane, medicinal and mundane 
A poultice for fever consisting of bitter leaf, wild barley, onion juice and seafoam. 
She is too sweet because she doesn’t have salt in her. 
If you spice the salt it is hot gossip, but then you should take it with a pinch of salt. 

Salt circles and flicking salt, lemon and chilli at a crossroads to ward off the demons eye, salt mines and salt pans, salt marches and salt mountains. Salty hands and feet and tears and sweat and blood.

A rock, a mineral. A landscape, a history.

A being whose bodies are found on land, dried up remnants of seas who are long gone, whose residue nourishes me, hydrates me, raises the pressure in my blood, or maintains it. 

When my ancestors washed up on shores, meeting nothing that wanted them. When that phrase became an insult, off the boat, new, different, alien, ironically unworldly, un-assimilated. Too foreign, too spicy, too pungent, too dark. 

Yet how quickly they forget, taking what they need, like they always do, to make themselves feel well in a world that is a unwell. A world whose unwellness feeds their wellness. 

How quickly we forget, turning salty bitter words that were thrown at us, bouncing off hands, arms, shoulders, elbows, turning fast to throw them against others. Stop those others floating on our seas, the buoyancy of salts raising some of us up at the expense of others, watching as humanity, our humanity, drowns (is drowned). 

If the sea is a brine and my blood is a brine and my cells and bones are contained in brine, if in me everything flows as brine, then the ocean is the amniotechnics of the fluid that birthed me as an alien on these shores.

71% of the world’s surface is ocean, roughly 97% of all water on Earth, the volume totalling approximately 1.332 billion cubic kilometers, fast increasing as the polar icecaps melt. If the entropy of the ocean is generated by processes like mixing of heat and salt, and the dissipation of energy from waves and currents, then the thermal mixing is the largest contributor to the ocean's entropy production rate. This water is finite.

The brine becomes less concentrated, and the air is warmer, and microorganisms proliferate, causing harmful algae blooms. These cyanobacteria bloom beautiful, but toxic, killing marine life through oxygen depletion as they die, leading to species loss and ecosystem collapse, and other harms that find their way into our food, water and air.

Of whose land I belong to, and who gets to belong there with me
Whose hands cultivate me, caring, clipping, harvesting, packing

Crossing borders that would turn them away
I have never been native anywhere, except here, now, as 
A seed that is a spice that is a fruit that is a plant, a landscape.

An entire world.

//“There must be something strangely sacred in salt. 
It is in our tears and in the sea.”//
(text-size: 0.75)[—Khalil Gibran, Sand and Foam, 1926.]

Take a pinch of salt, and sprinkle into the jar of tap water.
It will both preserve and transform you.

(text-style:"buoy")+(text-size: 1.5)[This is a story about salt]



The story will guide you through the [[THREE FIELDS]] of the project using salt and [[spices]], as materials and metaphors, as seeds, as landscapes, as entire worlds.

As a journey we are taking you on.

Start where you are.

The story is incomplete, but parts of it you can fill in using your own story and your own journey.
