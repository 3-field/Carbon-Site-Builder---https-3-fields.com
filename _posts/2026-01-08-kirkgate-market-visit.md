Following a site visit of the Kirkgate Market in Leeds earlier this summer, where Kaajal Modi guided the Three Fields UK team throughout the stalls and the alleys of the indoor and outdoor Victorian market, in November the artist embarked on a four-week residency at the market. 

Accompanied by the first frost of the year, Kaajal had access to a stall, where they brought into action some of the conversations they had been sharing with Deepa Reddy and Samukelisiwe Dube as part of their remote translocal collaboration.

Kaajal used this opportunity to deepen the dialogue with some of the food traders in the market - particularly those selling herbs and spices - as part of their ongoing interest in the relationship between people, knowledge, and ingredients, and the histories of migration, movement and exchange that they reveal.

As part of the residency Kaajal led two workshops around fermenting, listening, and dyeing. They experimented with mixing spices - for instance preparing kala namak / black salt from cinnamon pepper and salt - while engaging people on a sensory journey into plants and their multiple lives made of sounds, smells and warmth.

The ecologies of Kirkgate Market materialise UK food culture, the sinews of food trade, production, preparation and sale that have global reach. It is UK food culture in microcosm; the way we eat here has shaped and continues to reshape the landscapes and geographies of places in the majority world (including India and South Africa). Samu, Deepa and I wanted to find a way to triangulate this relationship and render it tangible / sense-able to our audiences, and each of us found ways to do this in our own fields.
