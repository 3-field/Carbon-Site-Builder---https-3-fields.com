**THREE FIELDS: Listening to spices as seeds, plants, and landscapes** 
21-22 Feb 2026
<hr>

**Listening across THREE FIELDS**
21 Feb 2026, 2.30pm

In this session, the artists speak about the project, its goals, and the processes of how it led them to tell stories of food, ecology and people. 

Why did they decide to use spices as entry points to food systems? Why do stories of migration and movement matter, and why should we listen? Have you ever heard a spice talk, and what would you expect it to say? Join the THREE FIELDS artists for a kitchen table conversation about the collaboration process, and how it unfolded as a prototype installation, presented at EyeMyth for the first time.
