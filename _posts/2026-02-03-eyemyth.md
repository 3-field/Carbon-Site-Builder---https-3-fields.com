As part of Eyemyth in Dehli, a prototype artwork will be presented alongside a panel discussion with the artists exploring the process of remote collaboration. 

**THREE FIELDS: Listening to spices as seeds, plants, and landscapes** 
21-22 Feb 2026
<hr>
In 2025, artists Deepa Reddy (Pondicherry, India), Kaajal Modi (Leeds, UK) and Samukelisiwe Siphesihle Dube (Johannesburg, South Africa) came together for THREE FIELDS - a remote collaboration exploring sustainable creative digital practices. 

Conscious of the many ways in which movements of plants, people, and food have made modern food systems as they are—whether forced and desired, engineered and organic, industrial and personal—conversations between the artists gravitated towards food migrations. 

A key modality throughout the collaboration has been listening: to each other, to stories that specific ingredients such as spices carry, to the interstices between things loudly and commonly known, and the gaps where no sounds go.

What do we hear when we listen to spices speaking? The prototype exhibited at EyeMyth explores this via three unique binaural soundscapes, each of them returning us to ecologies and landscapes lost in mass commerce and industrial-scale production. 

**Listening across THREE FIELDS**
21 Feb 2026, 2.30pm

In this session, the artists speak about the project, its goals, and the processes of how it led them to tell stories of food, ecology and people. 

Why did they decide to use spices as entry points to food systems? Why do stories of migration and movement matter, and why should we listen? Have you ever heard a spice talk, and what would you expect it to say? Join the THREE FIELDS artists for a kitchen table conversation about the collaboration process, and how it unfolded as a prototype installation, presented at EyeMyth for the first time.
