				<p class="editable">
Abandon Normal Devices (AND) is a commissioning agency and a catalyst for new approaches to art-making and digital invention. We create ground-breaking projects which challenge the definitions of art and moving image with a distinct emphasis on creative enquiry and provocations. Since its inception in 2009, AND has shaken the creative sector through radical, risk-taking projects that challenge conventional modes of participation, and stimulate new art forms and creative inquiry. AND brings together an eclectic mix of academics, filmmakers, scientists and anarchists to actively push the boundaries of audience experience and arts production. Inviting artists to hijack the imagination, by developing projects which abandon traditional settings and partnerships. Proposing a significant shift in the way art is experienced, the AND portfolio consists of site-specific film happenings, exhibitions, performances, online projects, residencies, public realm interventions and a roaming biennial festival. Audiences are invited to interact with bold ideas, encounter new art-forms and experience art, in the everyday and in unexpected locations.
