				<h2 class="editable">AND</h2>
				<p class="editable">
Abandon Normal Devices (AND) is a radical arts organisation, situated in the North of England and working globally. AND is renowned for producing the UK's only nomadic, site-responsive digital arts festival, commissioning works which combine creativity, technology, and science, challenging norms and fostering critical dialogue through immersive experiences grounded in ethics, sustainability and inclusion. Since 2009 we have commissioned and supported hundreds of artists to push the boundaries of their creative practice, by making space for provocation, risk-taking, and experimentation that enable new artforms to emerge.
