				<p class="editable">
Abandon Normal Devices (AND) is a radical arts organisation, situated in the North of England and working globally. AND is renowned for producing the UK's only nomadic, site-responsive digital arts festival, commissioning works which combine creativity, technology, and science, challenging norms and fostering critical dialogue through immersive experiences grounded in ethics, sustainability and inclusion. Since 2009 we have commissioned and supported hundreds of artists to push the boundaries of their creative practice, by making space for provocation, risk-taking, and experimentation that enable new artforms to emerge.

Unlikely communities in unusual spaces, imagining the unknown. Unbox Cultural Futures builds community at the intersection of disciplines to explore new narratives and reimagine India’s plural futures. Conceived in 2011 as a festival for inquiry and exploration, UCF has since evolved into a dynamic ecosystem of labs, public engagement platforms, research projects, art, installations, and publications to explore new narratives for cultural enquiry and expressions. UCF brings together diverse practitioners – artists, researchers, designers, and communities to co‑create spaces of inquiry and expression.

Arts Catalyst is a visual arts organisation and charity based in Sheffield, UK, enabling people in South Yorkshire and beyond to engage in creative experiences that increase ecological awareness, encourage positive social action and open up new ways of learning about the world around us. We activate spaces for people to think differently about the world around them using art to explore social and environmental issues, provoke debate, and test out alternative ways of learning. We collaborate with artists, activists and people with different kinds of knowledge to organise creative projects that respond to social and environmental issues. Our programme often takes place within community spaces, unusual sites and outdoors.
