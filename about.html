As part of the British Council’s International Collaboration Programme we are excited to announce THREE FIELDS - a new international co-commission between organisations from India, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Together we will develop an innovative immersive artwork using sustainable digital production tools; documenting and setting a new precedent for environmentally conscious creative digital practices. Over the next 7 months artists and creative practitioners from across the three territories will come together to collaborate and develop a new piece of work exploring food systems, from regenerative agricultural practices to indigenous knowledges.

				<h2 class="editable">AND</h2>
				<p class="editable">
Abandon Normal Devices (AND) is a commissioning agency and a catalyst for new approaches to art-making and digital invention. We create ground-breaking projects which challenge the definitions of art and moving image with a distinct emphasis on creative enquiry and provocations. Since its inception in 2009, AND has shaken the creative sector through radical, risk-taking projects that challenge conventional modes of participation, and stimulate new art forms and creative inquiry. AND brings together an eclectic mix of academics, filmmakers, scientists and anarchists to actively push the boundaries of audience experience and arts production. Inviting artists to hijack the imagination, by developing projects which abandon traditional settings and partnerships. Proposing a significant shift in the way art is experienced, the AND portfolio consists of site-specific film happenings, exhibitions, performances, online projects, residencies, public realm interventions and a roaming biennial festival. Audiences are invited to interact with bold ideas, encounter new art-forms and experience art, in the everyday and in unexpected locations.

				<p class="editable">
Arts Catalyst is a visual arts organisation and charity based in Sheffield, UK, enabling people in South Yorkshire and beyond to engage in creative experiences that increase ecological awareness, encourage positive social action and open up new ways of learning about the world around us. We activate spaces for people to think differently about the world around them using art to explore social and environmental issues, provoke debate, and test out alternative ways of learning. We collaborate with artists, activists and people with different kinds of knowledge to organise creative projects that respond to social and environmental issues. Our programme often takes place within community spaces, unusual sites and outdoors.
